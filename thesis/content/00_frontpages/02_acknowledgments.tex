\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
\label{cha:acknowledgments}

I would first like to thank my supervisor Philip Raschke at Service-centric Network department of the Technische Universität Berlin. Philip and I spent a lot of time to explore research areas in the field of targeted advertising. In these sessions, we came up with the research question and designed the concept from scratch. Philip always motivated me to explore the research field of unpaid content and provided me expert knowledge on this matter. 

Secondly, I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Küpper for the feedback that he provided after the initial talk. This inspired me to look at the concept with a critical view and make the scope more clear.

Lastly, I am really thankful for the great tools that are made freely available by the opensource community. It is really a fantastic experience to see software being developed in parallel and see new features being introduced during this research.
