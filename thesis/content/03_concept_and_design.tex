\chapter{Concept and Design}
\label{cha:conceptanddesign}
The proposed solution is an implementation which is completely based on the existing infrastructure that is available on the web. This comes with the advance that it works across all different types of devices, from desktop computers to smartphones. Another feature of this approach is that it does not require any additional tools, which might need some effort to setup.

\section{Architecture}
There are basically two components in this system: there is a wallet, which takes care of the storage of encryption keys and is responsible for handling all communications with a cryptocurrency network. The second part is the publisher library, which can be embedded by any website who want to take part in the universal-pay ecosystem. 

\subsection{Wallet}
The wallet will be, like all the other parts of the architecture, implemented in standard web technology, which means Javascript. For the convenience of the end user, the wallet will be hosted on a domain to make sure that for the system to work, still no additional configuration is needed. However, this requires trust. If the owner of the domain becomes malicious, the entire wallet might be stolen. Therefore, the user is free to host his own wallet on every desired location, even \textit{localhost} is a possiblity.
