\label{cha:conclusion}

The problem of unpaid content is something that already existed from the early days of the World Wide Web. As of today, the main revenue model that is applied at online content is (targeted) web advertising.

This thesis presents a fully working prototype of system that could be an alternative to web advertising. The idea of the system is that web advertising generate a very small amount of revenue for each impression or click. In order to offer an advertisement free web experience that is still fair to the publisher, the system pays the revenue that would be missed out on. 

The challenges of building such a system are very interesting. Firstly, as the revenue of a single advertisement impression is a matter of tenths of cents, there is a system needed that can facilitate payments with these very low amounts and even lower transaction fees. Secondly, these needs to be a model that determines what amount gets paid to a publisher. Thirdly, in order to make such a system successful, wide adoption is needed. Therefore, it should be easy to take part in the system from both sides: the publisher and the internet user.
