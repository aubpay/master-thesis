\chapter{Performance Analysis \& Evaluation}
\label{cha:evaluation}

The concept that is designed in this thesis is evaluated with two different software projects: the Lightning Sprinkle User Service and the Lightning Sprinkle Publisher Library, which are written in Python and Javascript respectively. 

\section{Technical}

The goal of these software projects is to prove that it is possible to implement that is an answer to the concept that is stated in section \ref{sec:uaps}. These requirements will be used as part of the evaluation, combined with a couple of performance tests. Performance tests that include: the scalability of the platform and response time. 

\noindent The original concept from section \ref{sec:uaps} is:

Concept: \textit{Distribute a small amount of money over the publishers behind the websites you visit and hide the advertisements}

\noindent The challenges can be translated into the following requirements:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Minimal configuration
  \item Decentral
  \item Fair distribution
  \item Tamper proof
\end{enumerate}
