Revenue models on the internet to monetize online content is a topic that has been actively researched and experimented with over the past few decades. Even in the early days of the World Wide Web, the problem of unpaid content existed. These approaches include paywalls and web advertisements. For example, the \textit{Wall Street Journal} implemented already a hard paywall in 1996, which is still in place as of today, with over 2 million subscribers as of February 2020 \footnote{\url{}}. %https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/02/the-wall-street-journal-joins-the-new-york-times-in-the-2-million-digital-subscriber-club/

Alternatives to hard paywalls are soft paywalls. The difference between both types is that soft paywalls are trying to convince potential customers to subscribe by giving them a free sample of the content. For example, the \textit{New York Times} has implemented a soft paywall with a limit of 5 free articles per month. 

\section{Brave Browser}
In 2016, Brave Software launched a browser that blocked ads and trackers by default, the Brave Browser \footnote{\url{https://www.brave.com}}. During the introduction, Brave Software also shared their plans for a Brave Publisher Ads program to pay publishers back fair a share of internet revenue. As of 2020, their service is called "Brave rewards program", and any content creator can enroll in order to get paid for content. 

\subsection{Basic Attention Token} 
In order to achieve a system that makes it possible to reward content makers on the internet, Brave introduced the Basic Attention Token. This token, which works like any other cryptocurrency, represents user attention. Their goal with this token is to trade "attention" just like any other commodity, like oil and coffee. This means that the this token can also be traded on a cryptocurrency exchange.

Brave Software used an initial coin offering to introduce the new token to the market. The ICO happened in May 2017 and raised 156,000 ETH, which was worth around 35M USD at the time. The raised money is mostly used to pay for the development and other costs of the token. The development team exists out of 20 developers.
