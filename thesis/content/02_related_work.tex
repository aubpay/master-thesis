In 2016, Brave Software launched a browser that blocked ads and trackers by default, the Brave Browser \footnote{\url{https://www.brave.com}}. During the introduction, Brave Software also shared their plans for a Brave Publisher Ads program to pay publishers back fair a share of internet revenue.

\subsection{Basic Attention Token} 
In order to achieve a system that makes it possible to reward content makers on the internet, Brave introduced the Basic Attention Token. This token, which works like any other cryptocurrency, represents user attention. Their goal with this token is to trade "attention" just like any other commodity, like oil and coffee. This means that the this token can also be traded on a cryptocurrency exchange.
