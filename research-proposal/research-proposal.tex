\section{Introduction}

The business of online advertising has evolved to a landscape which is not transparent anymore. Almost every movement during the visit of a regular website is sent in an obfuscated way to the advertisement broker, without any visible sign to the end user. This makes the whole browsing experience obnoxious, especially now it turns out that entire societies are influenced by the power of advertisement networks.
